## FubuMVC.Json

The default IJsonReader implementation in FubuMVC simply deserializes your model. It does not hook into the powerful model binding infrastructure in Fubu. This takes care of that for you.

## How do I use it?

Simply install it via NuGet:

> Install-Package EmbeddedMail

### Wait, that's it?

FubuMVC will pick this up as a Bottle and automatically configure everything for you :)
